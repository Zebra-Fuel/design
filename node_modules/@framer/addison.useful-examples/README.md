Hello there! Here is a cool package you can download when looking to explore some cool features / things you can do with Framer X and Code. 

You can also find some templates for creating your own components and use the already created ones as a guide.

Some examples that you can currently check out include:

- Making API Calls
- NPM components
- Vue Components

Additionally, you can find separate Code Override files for things like:

- Getting and using text from Inputs
- Page tool on click, and to update page dots from the example kit (https://store.framer.com/package/framer/examples)
- Page tool on swipe, and to update the page dots from the example kit (https://store.framer.com/package/framer/examples)

In order to find the code overrides, you can navigate to the node_modules folder and look inside @framer/useful-examples/code/Overrides and copy the overrides you need : )

Will be continuously updating these with other useful examples, so if you have an idea for me to add, tweet me @addisonschultz
